# AI Powered Autofill - User Guide

## Overview

The AI Powered Autofill feature uses OpenAI's language models to intelligently analyze job application forms and automatically fill them with your profile information. This advanced feature provides more accurate and context-aware form filling compared to traditional autofill methods.

## Getting Started

### 1. Enable AI Mode

1. **Open Extension Options**
   - Right-click the extension icon and select "Options"
   - Or go to Chrome Extensions page and click "Options" for the Job Autofill extension

2. **Configure AI Settings**
   - Navigate to the "AI Configuration" section
   - Toggle "Enable AI Mode" to ON
   - Enter your OpenAI API token (see "Getting an API Token" below)
   - Click "Save Settings"

### 2. Getting an OpenAI API Token

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to the API section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key and paste it into the extension settings

**Important**: Keep your API token secure and never share it with others.

### 3. Set Up Your Profile

Ensure your profile is complete with:
- Personal information (name, email, phone)
- Professional experience
- Education details
- Skills and certifications
- Job preferences

The more complete your profile, the better the AI can fill forms accurately.

## Using AI Autofill

### On Job Application Pages

1. **Navigate to a job application page**
2. **Look for the AI Autofill button** - It appears as "AI Powered Autofill" when AI mode is enabled
3. **Click the button** to start the AI analysis and autofill process
4. **Monitor progress** - The system will show progress updates as it:
   - Analyzes the form structure
   - Generates filling instructions
   - Executes the form filling

### Understanding the Process

The AI autofill works in several stages:

1. **Form Analysis**: The AI examines the HTML structure of the form
2. **Context Understanding**: It identifies field types and purposes
3. **Data Matching**: It matches your profile data to appropriate fields
4. **Instruction Generation**: It creates specific filling instructions
5. **Execution**: It fills the form fields with your information

### Fallback Behavior

If AI autofill encounters issues:
- It automatically falls back to traditional autofill methods
- You'll see a notification explaining what happened
- The system continues to fill what it can using standard matching

## AI Preferences and Customization

### Tone Settings
- **Professional**: Formal, business-appropriate language
- **Casual**: Relaxed, conversational tone
- **Enthusiastic**: Energetic, passionate language

### Custom Instructions
Add specific instructions for the AI, such as:
- "Emphasize my leadership experience"
- "Focus on technical skills for engineering roles"
- "Highlight remote work experience"

### Field Exclusions
Exclude specific fields from AI autofill:
- Salary expectations (if you prefer to handle manually)
- Cover letter fields
- Sensitive personal information

### Confidence Threshold
Set the minimum confidence level (0-100%) for AI suggestions:
- Higher values = more conservative, fewer fields filled
- Lower values = more aggressive, more fields filled

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

2. **Clear Instructions**: Specific custom instructions help the AI understand your preferences
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep your profile information current
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check your OpenAI API usage to manage costs
