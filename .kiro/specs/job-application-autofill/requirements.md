# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Job Application Autofill Chrome Extension is designed to streamline and automate the job application process across popular job platforms including LinkedIn, Indeed, Workday, and custom employer forms. The extension will function as an intelligent autofill tool that goes beyond basic browser autofill by understanding job application contexts, integrating AI-powered content generation, and handling complex form interactions including file uploads. The primary goal is to significantly reduce the time and effort required to complete job applications while maintaining personalization and accuracy.
