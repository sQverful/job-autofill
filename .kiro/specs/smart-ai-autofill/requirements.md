# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces AI-powered smart detection and autofill capabilities to the job application extension. Users can enable "AI Mode" by providing an OpenAI API token, which unlocks intelligent form analysis and automated filling. The system leverages LLM capabilities to analyze HTML form structures and generate precise filling instructions, while the extension remains responsible for executing these instructions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to enable AI Mode by providing my OpenAI API token, so that I can access intelligent autofill capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to extension options OR opens the popup THEN the system SHALL display an "AI Mode" configuration section
2. WHEN the user enters a valid OpenAI API token THEN the system SHALL validate the token and enable AI Mode
3. IF the API token is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep AI Mode disabled
4. WHEN AI Mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL securely store the API token using Chrome extension storage
5. WHEN the user disables AI Mode THEN the system SHALL keep the stored API token but disable AI functionality
6. WHEN the user clicks "delete token from cache" THEN the system SHALL remove the stored API token

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker with AI Mode enabled, I want to see an "AI Autofill" button on job application forms, so that I can trigger intelligent form filling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI Mode is enabled AND the user visits a job application page THEN the system SHALL detect form elements
2. WHEN form elements are detected THEN the system SHALL display an "AI Autofill" button in the UI
3. IF AI Mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "AI Autofill" button
4. WHEN no fillable forms are detected THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "AI Autofill" button
5. WHEN the page content changes THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate form detection and button visibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the AI to analyze the form structure and generate filling instructions, so that the system knows exactly what to fill and how.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "AI Autofill" THEN the system SHALL extract the HTML structure of detected forms
2. WHEN HTML is extracted THEN the system SHALL send a request to OpenAI API with the HTML and a predefined prompt
3. WHEN the API responds THEN the system SHALL receive a JSON structure containing filling instructions
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and abort the autofill process
5. WHEN instructions are received THEN the system SHALL validate the JSON structure before processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to execute the AI-generated instructions to fill the form, so that my job application is completed automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid instructions are received THEN the system SHALL execute text input actions using provided CSS selectors
2. WHEN text input actions are specified THEN the system SHALL fill input fields with the appropriate values
3. WHEN click actions are specified THEN the system SHALL perform clicks on elements using provided CSS selectors
4. WHEN dropdown selections are specified THEN the system SHALL select appropriate options
5. IF any instruction fails to execute THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining instructions
6. WHEN all instructions are processed THEN the system SHALL notify the user of completion status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want my personal data to be used intelligently by the AI, so that form fields are filled with relevant and accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating instructions THEN the system SHALL include user profile data in the API request
2. WHEN the AI analyzes forms THEN it SHALL match form fields to appropriate user data
3. WHEN multiple data options exist THEN the AI SHALL select the most relevant information for each field
4. WHEN custom fields are encountered THEN the AI SHALL provide intelligent suggestions based on context
5. WHEN sensitive data is involved THEN the system SHALL handle it according to privacy requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the AI autofill to handle complex form interactions, so that even sophisticated application forms can be completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multi-step forms are detected THEN the system SHALL handle form navigation between steps
2. WHEN conditional fields appear THEN the system SHALL adapt filling strategy based on form state
3. WHEN file uploads are required THEN the system SHALL identify upload fields and provide appropriate instructions
4. WHEN form validation occurs THEN the system SHALL handle validation errors and retry with corrected data
5. WHEN dynamic content loads THEN the system SHALL wait for content to be available before proceeding

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to review and control the AI autofill process, so that I maintain oversight of my job applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI autofill is triggered THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
2. WHEN instructions are being executed THEN the system SHALL show which fields are being filled
3. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of actions taken
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested actions
5. WHEN the user wants to stop THEN the system SHALL provide a way to cancel the autofill process

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to learn from successful applications, so that future autofill accuracy improves over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autofill completes successfully THEN the system SHALL store successful patterns for future reference
2. WHEN similar forms are encountered THEN the system SHALL leverage previous successful strategies
3. WHEN user makes manual corrections THEN the system SHALL learn from these corrections
4. WHEN form structures change THEN the system SHALL adapt based on historical success patterns
5. WHEN privacy settings allow THEN the system SHALL anonymously contribute to pattern improvement
