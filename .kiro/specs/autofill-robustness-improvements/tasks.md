# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement Safe Selector Pattern
  - Add safeQuerySelector utility method that validates selectors before use
  - Implement automatic selector sanitization for common invalid patterns (numeric IDs, special characters)
  - Add try-catch wrapper around all querySelector calls with fallback strategies
  - Create generic selector validation that works for any CSS selector type
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Add Profile Data Completeness Validation
  - Implement getProfileValue method that checks for missing data and provides intelligent defaults
  - Add profile data validation that ensures all common form fields have corresponding values
  - Create fallback value generation based on field context and type
  - Implement "Prefer not to say" defaults for demographic fields when no data exists
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7_

- [x] 3. Enhance Component Detection with Adaptive Patterns
  - Update isReactSelect method to use multiple detection strategies in sequence
  - Add flexible component detection that adapts to different implementations
  - Implement detection confidence scoring to choose best detection method
  - Create generic component detection pattern that works beyond just React Select
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Implement Multi-Strategy Interaction Pattern
  - Update fillField method to try multiple interaction approaches automatically
  - Add interaction strategy chain: direct input → click events → keyboard simulation → DOM manipulation
  - Implement automatic fallback from complex components to standard HTML when needed
  - Create generic interaction pattern that adapts to component behavior
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Add Resilient Processing Pattern
  - Update fillForm method to continue processing all fields even when individual fields fail
  - Implement error isolation so one field failure doesn't break entire form filling
  - Add comprehensive error collection and reporting without stopping execution
  - Create graceful degradation that maximizes successful field fills
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Enhance Field Mapping with Context Intelligence
  - Update getFieldMapping method to use context-aware mapping logic
  - Add intelligent field type detection based on labels, placeholders, and surrounding text
  - Implement mapping confidence scoring and alternative suggestions
  - Create adaptive mapping that learns from field patterns
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Add Comprehensive Logging and Debugging Pattern
  - Implement structured logging throughout the autofill process
  - Add success/failure tracking with detailed context for each operation
  - Create debugging output that helps identify patterns in failures
  - Implement performance and success rate monitoring
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 8. Create Robust Form Detection Pipeline
  - Update detectAndIndicateForms to handle detection failures gracefully
  - Add form detection validation and error recovery
  - Implement multiple form detection strategies with automatic fallbacks
  - Create detection pipeline that continues working despite individual detection failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Implement Dynamic Error Recovery System
  - Add automatic retry logic with different strategies when operations fail
  - Implement intelligent error analysis to choose appropriate recovery methods
  - Create self-healing patterns that adapt to different failure modes
  - Add error pattern learning to improve future success rates
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 10. Add Comprehensive Testing and Validation
  - Create test scenarios that cover various failure patterns and edge cases
  - Add automated testing for error recovery and graceful degradation
  - Implement validation testing with different component types and implementations
  - Create performance testing for resilient processing patterns
  - _Requirements: All requirements - comprehensive validation_
