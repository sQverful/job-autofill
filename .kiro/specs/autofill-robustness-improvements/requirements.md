# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The autofill system is experiencing several critical issues in production that prevent successful form filling on job application sites. Based on real-world console errors, we need to systematically address selector validation failures, missing profile data mappings, React Select component detection issues, and improve overall system robustness with better error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Selector Validation and Safety

**User Story:** As a user, I want the autofill system to handle invalid CSS selectors gracefully so that form detection doesn't crash when encountering malformed selectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters an invalid CSS selector THEN it SHALL catch the error and log a warning instead of crashing
2. WHEN a querySelector fails with a syntax error THEN the system SHALL skip that selector and continue processing other elements
3. WHEN form detection encounters malformed selectors THEN it SHALL validate selectors before attempting to use them
4. WHEN selector validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages for debugging

### Requirement 2: Complete Profile Data Coverage

**User Story:** As a user, I want all demographic and preference fields to have corresponding profile data so that forms can be filled completely without "field path not found" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system looks for privacy_consent data THEN it SHALL find a valid mapping in defaultAnswers
2. WHEN the system looks for pronouns data THEN it SHALL find a valid mapping in defaultAnswers
3. WHEN the system looks for gender_identity data THEN it SHALL find a valid mapping in defaultAnswers
4. WHEN the system looks for sexual_orientation data THEN it SHALL find a valid mapping in defaultAnswers
5. WHEN the system looks for disability data THEN it SHALL find a valid mapping in defaultAnswers
6. WHEN the system looks for neurodivergent data THEN it SHALL find a valid mapping in defaultAnswers
7. WHEN any demographic field is requested THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate default values or "Prefer not to say" options

### Requirement 3: Enhanced React Select Component Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want React Select components to be reliably detected and filled so that dropdown fields work consistently across different job sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters a React Select component THEN it SHALL successfully detect the control element
2. WHEN React Select detection fails with the primary method THEN it SHALL try multiple fallback detection strategies
3. WHEN a React Select component is found THEN the system SHALL successfully locate the input element within it
4. WHEN React Select interaction fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative interaction methods
5. WHEN all React Select methods fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed debugging information about the component structure

### Requirement 4: Improved Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the autofill system to continue working even when individual fields fail so that partial form filling is still possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any individual field filling fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining fields
2. WHEN an error occurs during form detection THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context for debugging
3. WHEN field mapping fails THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative mappings or provide fallback values
4. WHEN React component interaction fails THEN the system SHALL attempt standard HTML fallback methods
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a detailed error log for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5: Accurate Field Mapping and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want form fields to be mapped to the correct profile data so that the right information appears in each field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ethnicity fields are detected THEN they SHALL map to ethnicity data, not city data
2. WHEN work authorization fields are detected THEN they SHALL map to appropriate authorization status
3. WHEN demographic fields are detected THEN they SHALL map to corresponding demographic profile data
4. WHEN field mapping is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use intelligent context-based mapping
5. WHEN no exact mapping exists THEN the system SHALL provide reasonable default values based on field context

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Debugging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging information so that I can quickly identify and fix autofill issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form detection runs THEN it SHALL log the number of forms found and any detection issues
2. WHEN field filling occurs THEN it SHALL log success/failure status for each field with context
3. WHEN React Select interaction happens THEN it SHALL log the detection method used and component structure
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL include stack traces and component context for debugging
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL provide a summary report of filling success rates and common failure patterns
